### Hi there!

I'm Lili, a design engineer.

Currently learning front-end development and exploring UI/UX.
I enjoy building projects from scratch and keeping things clean and minimal.

Outside of coding, I love reading books, watching anime, exploring nature, practicing yoga, and spending time with my cockatiel.

#### My favorite line:

**"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.❤️✨"**
